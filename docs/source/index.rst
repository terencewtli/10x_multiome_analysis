IGVF - 10X Multiome Analysis documentation
===================================

This website contains documentation pertaining
to the analysis of 10X scRNA/scATAC-seq multiome data in
preparation for UCLA's IGVF pilot project. I include
all code used to generate all intermediate
files and data, starting from fastq files.
I highlight the main steps performed
in a standard multiome analysis and
document popular computational approaches
and software tools available at each step.
